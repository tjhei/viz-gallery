<h1>Snapshot of a global convection model</h1>

<p>by Rene Gassm&ouml;ller and Juliane Dannberg (University of Florida).

<p>
The global mantle convection simulation covers 1 billions years of plate motion
history that is prescribed at the surface and the graphic shown is 
the final state. Plumes are shown in red-yellow (using an isosurface
of high temperature) and subducted slabs are shown in blue (using an
isosurface of low temperature).

<p>
The simulation is done using the ASPECT code available at <a href="https://aspect.geodynamics.org">aspect.geoydnamics.org</a>
