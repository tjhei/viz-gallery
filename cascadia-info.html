The Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) represents a ~1000 km plate boundary zone extending from northern California to southern British Columbia, separating two tectonic plates: Juan de Fuca and the Pacific plate. The Juan de Fuca plate is continuously generated by a mid-oceanic ridge system east of the CSZ while subducting under the North American plate along the CSZ. As a consequence, CSZ describes a complex tectonic setting capable of generating moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes and volcanoes as the two plates interact with each other.

<p>To better understand the region and the associated hazard, the authors develop three-dimensional instantaneous geodynamic models that can accurately represent the structure of the uppermost mantle (lithospheric plates and the underlying asthenosphere) and the observed plate motions. In these models, the subducting Juan the Fuca slab is defined using the slab2 dataset (Hayes et al., 2018) that gives a detailed 3D slab geometry of all the active subduction zones, and the plates are defined using the lithospheric and crustal structure taken from Litho1.0 (Priestley et al., 2018) and crust1.0 model (Laske et al., 2012), respectively. The models are set using the community mantle convection code ASPECT (Kronbichler et al., 2012; Heister et al., 2017; Bangerth et al., 2023)  with Geodynamics World Builder (Fraters et al., 2019) to represent the complicated plate and slab geometries. Running one such model with a minimum cell size of 2.5km and takes approximately XX hours on XX.
